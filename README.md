## Overview
The Chat Java Application is a robust and scalable chat application developed using Java. This application allows multiple users to engage in real-time chat sessions. It is designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, providing essential chat functionalities through a clean and intuitive interface.

**Note**: This project was completed in 2019 when I was still an amateur developer and before GitHub became common in Korea.

## Project Goals
- **Real-Time Communication**: Enable real-time messaging between multiple users.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the application can handle multiple concurrent users seamlessly.
- **Security**: Implement secure communication protocols to protect user data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for users.
- **Listening to Music**: Allow users to listen to music while chatting.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for users.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly.
- **Group Chats**: Support for creating and managing group chat sessions.
- **Private Messaging**: Option for users to have private conversations.
- **File Sharing**: Allow users to share files within chat sessions.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for new messages and user activities.
- **Music Integration**: Enable users to listen to music within the chat application.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Java**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **Socket Programming**: For enabling real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Multithreading**: To handle multiple client connections concurrently.
- **MySQL**: For storing user data and chat history.

### Frontend
- **Java Swing**: For building the graphical user interface.

## Project Structure

  - **client/**: Client-side application code.
  - **server/**: Server-side application code.
- **assets/**: Contains any images or static files used in the application.
- **README.md**: The main documentation file for the project.

## Project Achievements
- **Stable Communication**: Achieved stable real-time messaging with minimal latency.
- **User Growth**: Successfully scaled the application to handle hundreds of simultaneous users.
- **Positive Feedback**: Received positive feedback for the intuitive user interface and overall user experience.

## Role and Contributions
- **Project Manager**: Oversaw the entire project, ensuring timely delivery and meeting of project goals.
- **Backend Developer**: Implemented the server-side logic, including user authentication, message handling, and data storage.
- **Frontend Developer**: Developed the user interface using Java Swing, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

## Key Learning and Impact
Developing the Chat Java Application provided valuable experience in full-stack Java development, socket programming, and multithreading. This project enhanced my understanding of real-time communication systems and scalable application design. It also improved my project management skills, particularly in coordinating a development team and delivering a complex software solution.
